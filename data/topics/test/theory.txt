Bash basics.

Bash is a command-line shell used for executing commands, writing scripts, and automating tasks.
Key commands: `ls` – list files, `cd` – change directory, `cat` – view file contents.
Scripts start with `#!/bin/bash` and can be run via `bash script.sh` or `chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh`.
